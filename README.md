# Apollo247
Unit 2 construct week project
Apollo 27/7 website clone project!
We are creating this blog to share our experience of working on a project assigned to us by our Masai School.
Our team consists of the following members: 
Venkatesh M N
NAGA APPA RAO POLAMARASETTI
 Buvaneswaran S
 Gagan
 Abhay Kumar Pandey
 Vineeth Kutty.
Our group was assigned to work on a Digital Healthcare Platform website called Apollo 247 https://www.apollo247.com/
#Problem statement:
We have completed the Given website With our best Knowledge up to now 247 in six days.
( HOW WE DID IT )
Before answering the big question of “ how we did it? “, let me show you some snippets of our website clone.
— Landing Page Of Our Project —

_ Doctors Consult Page _

^ Pharmacy and Products Page ^

~Lab-Tests Page~

~Covid-19 page~

~Cart page~

~Login page~

I hope I am not presenting you with so many snippets. The snippets attached above are just some parts of what we have made so that you could compare them with the actual website.
Now answering the big question of how we did it, I would like to say that it is because of the guidance of our captain Chandra Sekhar he guides towards making the website pixel perfect, I and my wonderful teammates had, we able to achieve our goal. As part of Masai school, we have always believed that communication and skills are greater than knowledge so it is because of effective communication and sheer will to understand complicated things and make them simple to understand, that we were able to create the page with comparatively fewer resources and fewer time.
@ We used the following resources for our help:

#Concepts we covered in the entire unit:
HTML
2. CSS
3. DOM
4. Media query
5. Git
*** Efforts of Team Work ***
Step-1: First we make a Slack and Whatsapp group for better communication between all of the team members, Then we connect a zoom meeting discussion about a given project.
Step-2: In zoom meet we divide small parts of the project, to all the team, next all are collecting raw data for the project which content is better to merge and easy to complete work.
Step-3: Daily we connect a meet after a scrum and then discuss the past day's work and the present day's work, anyone has an issue all the teammates are helping solve the bug.
Step-4: Finally all push the data to Git hub main branch and do the backend of this project, that we face a lot of tension more discussion lot more changes will be occur.
Step-5: Complete the given project works after we talk about the presentation part of our project, and all our efforts go to the final result then we submit Successfully our project with our team efforts.
CHALLENGES WE FACED AND HOW WE SOLVED THEM
As it was the first time for us to collaborate remotely on a project. We faced quite a few challenges while developing the clone. The challenges we can remember are as follows:-
Git was fairly new to us and thus it became a challenge to merge the code and solve the conflicts. Sometimes we worked till 2 am just to merge the code and improve the final version afterward.
Another challenge was solving the problem of redundant CSS classes. It happened sometimes that there were few redundant classes and the output used to get disoriented. Solving it required a thorough checkup of class names and effective communication among us so that we could prevent it from happening.
We had to learn how to make animations and carousels as a few sections of some pages required us to create image cards, move the navbar, open & close animations, etc. Here, reading the documentation and looking at the snippets come in handy to solve such problems.
As we are not using UI libraries yet, we faced a lot of challenges while getting a similar layout on different screen sizes. Although we were able to manage most of it, this issue is something that we got to know could only be resolved with the UI libraries (which we have not studied yet), so we decide to move on and fix other things.
